# Challenges to security
The fundamental challenge in security is not just complexity, but that when testing complex systems we can not possibly test all possible inputs. As a result we mostly just test the range of inputs that will be used to meet the business goals. In the end most of the possible executions paths for software are never tested. Under normal circumstances this is fine, the untested paths will never be used; though exceptional circumstances can of course trigger them occasionally leading to catastrophic failure. But as an adversary your job is to find these interesting exceptional conditions that lead to failure and force them to happen. Attackers increase complexity by forcing the traversal of the road less taken.

It is worth asking how we got here, I think it can be viewed as the result of an environmental change.

## The Past
Computing is about seventy years old, and up until the late 90's the vast majority of computers were not globally connected; today a computer without a connection to the internet is hard to find. The new environment of connectivity has given birth to the death of distance and the global advisory. What once was a reasonable level of assurance and security became suddenly deficient and we have not yet adapted to this environmental change.

Is there anything we can do about this?

## The Challenges
The bad news is that the market is disincentive from adopting change.

### Externalized Risk
The manufacturers of software have externalized the risk software bugs onto their customers, and customers have little they can do to force software to improve.  Where regulation might help most of the largest companies in the world are software companies who have the most to lose from regulation, and their influence in politics makes regulation unlikely.

### Unquantified Risk
Insurance could be a way to price risk but the complexity today is causing insurers to pull back from issuing coverage for cyber attacks. They have accepted that they can not quantify their exposure for cyber coverage so are just exiting the market or pricing the policies to be effectively unaffordable.

### Security is the Irrational Choice
This inability to quantify cyber risk also means that for most businesses it is almost always better to focus, and spend, on the risks you understand than cyber where even the experts can't give you hard numbers for your spreadsheets.

So manufacturers aren't exposed to the risks they create, regulators are in their pockets, insurrers can't price the risk, and for end customers it is better to focus on problems where they can effect change.

### Network Pollution
In addition to this connected devices are polluting our networks. The average internet connected device will be in service far longer than the manufactures will support it. This is leading to a growing number of devices connected to the internet with known exploitable bugs. These "forever-day" bugs the toxic waist of the connected age.

## Opportunity
There is some good news. Our end goal doesn't need to be perfection, we just need the cost of finding an exploitable bug to be high enough that most attacks are unprofitable. To achieve this we can separate security controls from business logic, and use formal methods to validate more of the execution paths in the security controls. This is a journey we (the community) are just starting though.

## The Only Way is Forward
Even with all of this complexity and risk there is no walking back. As you stated, the benefits of connectivity and automation are lower costs and greater access to goods and services. If any company or organisation were to try to go back to pencil and paper they would be unable to compete for business and attention.

We should expect more complexity, more risk, and more attackers who are more aggressive.
